# Adyton of the Seven: Planetary Structure

## Overview

The Adyton of the Seven is a heptagonal (7-sided) structure with walls that correspond to the seven classical planets. Each wall contains 8 pillars, and each pillar rises 13 cubes high. This document serves as the canonical reference for the planetary attributions of the structure.

## Wall Attributions

The seven walls of the Adyton are attributed to the classical planets in the following special order:

1. Saturn Wall
2. Sun Wall
3. Mercury Wall
4. Moon Wall
5. Venus Wall
6. Jupiter Wall
7. Mars Wall

## Planetary Trigrams, Colors, and Letters

Each planet is associated with a specific trigram, RGB color value, and letter in the Trigrammaton font:

| ID | Trigram | Planet | Letter | Red | Green | Blue |
|----|---------|--------|--------|-----|-------|------|
| 13 | 111 | Sun (☉) | E | 254 | 0 | 0 |
| 22 | 211 | Jupiter (♃) | V | 254 | 194 | 0 |
| 14 | 112 | Saturn (♄) | R | 194 | 254 | 0 |
| 26 | 222 | Moon (☽) | ) | 0 | 254 | 254 |
| 17 | 122 | Venus (♀) | K | 60 | 60 | 254 |
| 25 | 221 | Mars (♂) | U | 0 | 0 | 254 |
| 16 | 121 | Mercury (☿) | Q | 254 | 0 | 60 |

These colors and trigrams will be used for identifying and coloring the wall and pillar elements of the Adyton structure.

## Column Attributions

Each wall features 8 columns (pillars). The columns are attributed to planets according to a specific pattern, where:

- The wall's governing planet always appears doubled in the central positions (columns 4 and 5)
- The three planets before the doubled planet are the three that precede it in the cycle
- The three planets after the doubled planet are the three that follow it in the cycle

## Cube Height Significance

Each pillar rises to a height of 13 cubes, representing the 13 lunar months or cosmic levels. The specific height of a celestial body's projection onto a pillar carries astronomical and symbolic significance.

## Truncated Pyramid Features

Each cube has a truncated pyramid extending from its inner face toward the center. These pyramids have five surfaces:

1. Four diagonal faces
2. One top square (the truncated face)

### Pyramid Face Coloring

The coloring of the truncated pyramid faces follows these rules:

1. **Right Diagonal Face**: This face must be colored with the RGB color value associated with the planet of the cube. For example:
   - For a cube on a pillar representing Saturn, the right diagonal face would be colored Chartreuse (194,254,0)
   - For a cube on a pillar representing the Sun, the right diagonal face would be colored Bright Red (254,0,0)

The planetary color is determined by the pillar's planetary attribution as defined in the Column Attributions section above.

The remaining faces (left diagonal, top diagonal, bottom diagonal, and truncated top square) will be colored according to other attributes to be defined.

## Implementation Notes

This structure serves as a three-dimensional model of celestial mechanics, allowing for the mapping of astronomical positions onto a sacred geometric structure. The placement of celestial bodies on specific pillars and at specific heights creates a complete representation of the cosmic state at any given moment.
