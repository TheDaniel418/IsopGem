# Backup and Export Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This file outlines the tasks required to implement the backup and export functionality for the Tag-Based Note Management System, enabling users to export and import all notes, tags, and attachments.

## Tasks

### 1. Export Format Design
- [ ] Design export file format:
  - [ ] Define JSON schema for notes, tags, and relationships

  - [ ] Define metadata structure (version, timestamp, etc.)
- [ ] Create format documentation
- [ ] Implement format validation utilities

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 2. Export Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/backup_export_service.py` with export functionality:
  - [ ] Implement note and tag data export
  - [ ] Create attachment file packaging
  - [ ] Implement metadata generation
  - [ ] Create progress reporting for long operations
- [ ] Implement export file creation:
  - [ ] Create ZIP archive with all data
  - [ ] Implement file naming and versioning
  - [ ] Create directory structure in archive

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 3. Import Implementation
- [ ] Implement import functionality:
  - [ ] Create import file validation
  - [ ] Implement note and tag data import
  - [ ] Create attachment file extraction
  - [ ] Implement metadata validation
  - [ ] Create progress reporting for long operations
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution:
  - [ ] Create duplicate detection
  - [ ] Implement merge strategies
  - [ ] Create user confirmation dialogs

**Estimated time:** 12-15 hours

### 4. Selective Export/Import
- [ ] Implement selective export:
  - [ ] Create note selection UI
  - [ ] Implement tag selection UI
  - [ ] Create dependency resolution (related tags, attachments)
- [ ] Implement selective import:
  - [ ] Create import preview UI
  - [ ] Implement item selection
  - [ ] Create dependency validation

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 5. Backup Scheduling
- [ ] Implement automatic backup functionality:
  - [ ] Create backup scheduling options
  - [ ] Implement background backup process
  - [ ] Create backup rotation and cleanup
- [ ] Implement backup status reporting
- [ ] Create backup verification utilities

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 6. Export/Import UI
- [ ] Create `ui/components/backup_export_ui.py` with:
  - [ ] Export options and destination selection
  - [ ] Import source selection
  - [ ] Progress display for long operations
  - [ ] Error reporting and recovery options
  - [ ] Conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Implement UI integration with main window

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Implement robust error handling:
  - [ ] Create validation at each step
  - [ ] Implement partial success handling
  - [ ] Create rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Implement recovery from failed operations:
  - [ ] Create temporary backups during import
  - [ ] Implement state restoration
  - [ ] Create detailed error reporting

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 8. Format Compatibility
- [ ] Implement version compatibility:
  - [ ] Create format version detection
  - [ ] Implement upgrade paths for older formats
  - [ ] Create downgrade paths for newer formats (if possible)
- [ ] Implement format migration utilities
- [ ] Create format documentation for each version

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 9. External Tool Integration
- [ ] Create command-line interface for backup/export (optional):
  - [ ] Implement export command
  - [ ] Create import command
  - [ ] Implement validation command
- [ ] Create API for external tool integration (optional)
- [ ] Implement logging for automated operations

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 10. Backup/Export Unit Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for export:
  - [ ] Test with various data sizes
  - [ ] Test with Unicode content
  - [ ] Test with all attachment types
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for import:
  - [ ] Test with valid and invalid data
  - [ ] Test conflict resolution
  - [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Test integration with other components

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 11. Backup/Export Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all backup/export-related classes and methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for backup/export functionality
- [ ] Document export file format
- [ ] Create best practices for backup management

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**81-101 hours** (approximately 2-2.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the backup and export implementation, proceed to implementing the cross-pillar communication as outlined in [10_cross_pillar_communication.md](10_cross_pillar_communication.md).
