# Repositories Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This file outlines the tasks required to implement the data storage and retrieval layer (repositories) for the Tag-Based Note Management System.

## Tasks

### 1. Repository Interfaces
- [ ] Create `repositories/interfaces.py` with the following interfaces:
  - [ ] `IRepository` - Base repository interface with CRUD operations
  - [ ] `INoteRepository` - Note-specific repository interface
  - [ ] `ITagRepository` - Tag-specific repository interface
  - [ ] `IAttachmentRepository` - Attachment-specific repository interface
  - [ ] Define method signatures and documentation

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

### 2. Storage Backend Selection and Implementation
- [ ] Evaluate and select appropriate storage backend:
  - [ ] SQLite for structured data (notes, tags, relationships)
  - [ ] File system for attachments
  - [ ] JSON files for configuration
- [ ] Create database schema for SQLite implementation
- [ ] Implement database connection and management
- [ ] Create migration mechanism for future schema changes

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 3. Note Repository Implementation
- [ ] Create `repositories/note_repository.py` implementing `INoteRepository`:
  - [ ] Create method (store new note)
  - [ ] Read method (retrieve note by UUID)
  - [ ] Update method (update existing note)
  - [ ] Delete method (remove note and handle cascading)
  - [ ] List method (retrieve all notes)
  - [ ] Query methods (filter by various criteria)
  - [ ] Tag relationship management
  - [ ] Unicode support for all text fields

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 4. Tag Repository Implementation
- [ ] Create `repositories/tag_repository.py` implementing `ITagRepository`:
  - [ ] Create method (store new tag)
  - [ ] Read method (retrieve tag by UUID)
  - [ ] Update method (update existing tag)
  - [ ] Delete method (remove tag and update relationships)
  - [ ] List method (retrieve all tags)
  - [ ] Query methods (filter by various criteria)
  - [ ] Note relationship management
  - [ ] Unicode support for tag names

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 5. Attachment Repository Implementation
- [ ] Create `repositories/attachment_repository.py` implementing `IAttachmentRepository`:
  - [ ] Create method (store new attachment file)
  - [ ] Read method (retrieve attachment metadata by UUID)
  - [ ] Update method (update attachment metadata)
  - [ ] Delete method (remove attachment file and metadata)
  - [ ] List method (retrieve all attachments for a note)
  - [ ] File system operations for attachment storage
  - [ ] Unicode support for filenames and paths

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 6. Repository Factory Implementation
- [ ] Create `repositories/factory.py` for repository instantiation
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for repositories
- [ ] Create configuration-based repository selection

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

### 7. Transaction Management
- [ ] Implement transaction support for database operations
- [ ] Create unit of work pattern for multi-repository operations
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanism for failed operations

**Estimated time:** 5-7 hours

### 8. Repository Unit Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Note repository
  - [ ] Test CRUD operations
  - [ ] Test relationship management
  - [ ] Test Unicode support
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Tag repository
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Attachment repository
- [ ] Test transaction management and rollback

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 9. Repository Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all repository classes and methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for repositories
- [ ] Document transaction management and error handling

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**53-68 hours** (approximately 1.5-2 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the repositories implementation, proceed to implementing the services as outlined in [04_services.md](04_services.md).
