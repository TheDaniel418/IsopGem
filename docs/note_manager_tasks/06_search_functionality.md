### 2. Document Indexing Implementation
- [ ] Create indexing logic for notes:
  - [ ] Extract text content from RTF format
  - [ ] Index note name, content, and metadata
  - [ ] Handle Unicode content (Greek, Hebrew)
- [ ] Create indexing logic for tags:
  - [ ] Index tag names and relationships
  - [ ] Handle Unicode content
- [ ] Implement batch indexing for initial setup
- [ ] Create incremental indexing for updates

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 3. Search Query Processing

- [ ] Handle Unicode in search queries

**Estimated time:** 12-15 hours

### 4. Search Results Management
- [ ] Implement result ranking and sorting
- [ ] Create pagination for large result sets

- [ ] Create performance monitoring

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 7. Advanced Search Features
- [ ] Implement saved searches functionality
- [ ] Create search history tracking
- [ ] Implement search suggestions based on history
- [ ] Create "similar notes" functionality
- [ ] Implement tag suggestions based on content

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 8. Search Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement index optimization strategies
- [ ] Create caching mechanisms for frequent searches
- [ ] Optimize query parsing for performance
- [ ] Implement asynchronous search for UI responsiveness

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 9. Search Unit Tests
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for indexing
  - [x] Test with Unicode content (Greek, Hebrew)
  - [x] Test with large documents
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for searching
  - [x] Test various query types
  - [x] Test Unicode queries
  - [x] Test performance with large indexes
- [x] Test integration with other components

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 10. Search Documentation
- [x] Write comprehensive docstrings for all search-related classes and methods
- [x] Create usage examples for search functionality
- [x] Document query syntax for advanced users
- [x] Create performance guidelines and best practices

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**79-98 hours** (approximately 2-2.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the search functionality implementation, proceed to implementing the attachment handling as outlined in [07_attachment_handling.md](07_attachment_handling.md).
