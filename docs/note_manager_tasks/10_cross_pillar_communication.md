# Cross-Pillar Communication Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This file outlines the tasks required to implement the cross-pillar communication functionality for the Tag-Based Note Management System, enabling integration and data exchange with other modules in the application.

## Tasks

### 1. Communication Architecture Design
- [ ] Design cross-pillar communication architecture:
  - [ ] Define data exchange format and structure
  - [ ] Create communication channels
  - [ ] Define event types and priorities
  - [ ] Design UUID-based note referencing system
- [ ] Create architecture documentation
- [ ] Identify integration points with other pillars

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 2. Data Exchange Format Implementation
- [ ] Define data exchange structure:
  - [ ] Create data packet structure (source, destination, timestamp)
  - [ ] Implement payload structure
  - [ ] Define standard operation types
  - [ ] Create serialization/deserialization methods
- [ ] Implement data validation
- [ ] Create data transformation utilities

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 3. Communication Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/cross_pillar_service.py` implementing `ICrossPillarService`:
  - [ ] Implement data sending interface
  - [ ] Create data receiving interface
  - [ ] Implement event subscription mechanism
  - [ ] Create routing logic
  - [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
- [ ] Create service initialization and shutdown logic

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 4. Event System Implementation
- [ ] Implement event-based communication:
  - [ ] Create event types for note operations
  - [ ] Implement event publishing mechanism
  - [ ] Create event subscription and handling
  - [ ] Implement event filtering and prioritization
- [ ] Create event logging and monitoring

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 5. Note Reference System
- [ ] Implement UUID-based note referencing:
  - [ ] Create reference resolution mechanism
  - [ ] Implement reference validation
  - [ ] Create reference tracking
  - [ ] Implement reference update on note changes
- [ ] Create reference documentation and examples

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 6. Integration with Other Pillars
- [ ] Identify and implement specific integrations:
  - [ ] Integration with astrology module (if applicable)
  - [ ] Integration with geometry module (if applicable)
  - [ ] Integration with other relevant modules
- [ ] Create integration documentation
- [ ] Implement integration tests

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 7. Notification System in UI
- [ ] Implement UI components for cross-pillar interactions:
  - [ ] Create notification system for incoming events
  - [ ] Implement action request UI
  - [ ] Create interaction history view
- [ ] Implement UI updates based on external events
- [ ] Create user preferences for notification handling

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 8. Security and Validation
- [ ] Implement data validation:
  - [ ] Create input sanitization
  - [ ] Implement authentication (if needed)
  - [ ] Create permission checking
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid data
- [ ] Create security documentation

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement asynchronous communication handling
- [ ] Create operation queuing for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Implement batching for efficiency
- [ ] Create performance monitoring and diagnostics

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 10. Cross-Pillar Unit Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for data exchange
- [ ] Implement integration tests with mock pillars
- [ ] Create stress tests for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 11. Cross-Pillar Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all cross-pillar classes and methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for cross-pillar communication
- [ ] Document operation types and data formats
- [ ] Create integration guide for other pillars

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**76-95 hours** (approximately 2-2.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the cross-pillar communication implementation, proceed to implementing the testing plan as outlined in [11_testing_plan.md](11_testing_plan.md).
