# Tag Note System Implementation Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive task lists for implementing the Tag-Based Note Management System as outlined in `docs/tag_note_system_plan.md`.

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into three main phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality** - Essential features to make the system usable
2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** - Additional features to improve user experience
3. **Phase 3: Cross-Pillar Communication & Advanced Features** - Integration with other system components and advanced capabilities

## Task List Files

The implementation tasks are organized into the following files:

1. [01_project_setup.md](01_project_setup.md) - Initial project structure and environment setup
2. [02_data_models.md](02_data_models.md) - Data models for notes, tags, and attachments
3. [03_repositories.md](03_repositories.md) - Data storage and retrieval implementation
4. [04_services.md](04_services.md) - Business logic services implementation
5. [05_ui_components.md](05_ui_components.md) - User interface components implementation
6. [06_search_functionality.md](06_search_functionality.md) - Search service and Whoosh integration
7. [07_attachment_handling.md](07_attachment_handling.md) - Attachment management implementation
8. [08_rtf_editor_integration.md](08_rtf_editor_integration.md) - Integration with existing RTF editor
9. [09_backup_export.md](09_backup_export.md) - Backup and export functionality
10. [10_cross_pillar_communication.md](10_cross_pillar_communication.md) - Cross-pillar messaging implementation
11. [11_testing_plan.md](11_testing_plan.md) - Comprehensive testing strategy
12. [12_deployment_integration.md](12_deployment_integration.md) - Integration with the main application

## Implementation Timeline

Each task file includes estimated time requirements for implementation. The overall project is expected to be completed in approximately 8-12 weeks, depending on developer availability and complexity encountered during implementation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- PyQt6
- Whoosh (for full-text search)
- Existing RTFEditorWindow component from `shared/ui/widgets/rtf_editor`

## Getting Started

Begin with the tasks in [01_project_setup.md](01_project_setup.md) to establish the foundation for the project.
