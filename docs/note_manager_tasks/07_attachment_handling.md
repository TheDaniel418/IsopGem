**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 2. File Upload Implementation
- [x] Create file selection dialog
- [x] Implement file copy/move to attachment storage
- [x] Create attachment metadata extraction:
  - [x] File size
  - [x] MIME type
  - [x] Creation/modification dates

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 4. Attachment Preview Implementation
- [x] Create preview generation for common file types:
  - [x] Images
  - [x] PDFs (thumbnail)
  - [x] Text files
- [x] Implement preview caching for performance
- [x] Create fallback icons for unsupported file types
- [x] Implement preview size options

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 5. Drag and Drop Support
- [x] Implement drag and drop for file upload:
  - [x] From file system to note
  - [x] Between notes
- [x] Create visual feedback during drag operations
- [x] Implement drop target validation
- [x] Handle multiple file drops

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 6. Attachment List UI
- [x] Create attachment list component:
  - [x] Display attachment name, type, size
  - [x] Thumbnail/icon display
  - [x] Context menu for operations
- [x] Implement sorting and filtering options
- [x] Create attachment selection mechanism
- [x] Implement batch operations on multiple attachments

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 7. Attachment Operations
- [x] Implement attachment rename functionality
- [x] Create attachment deletion with confirmation
- [x] Implement attachment moving between notes
- [x] Create attachment metadata editing
- [x] Implement attachment export to file system

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 8. File Type Handling
- [x] Create MIME type detection and validation
- [x] Implement file type restrictions (if needed)
- [x] Create custom handlers for specific file types
- [x] Implement file type icons for UI

**Estimated time:** 5-6 hours

### 9. Attachment Indexing for Search
- [x] Implement text extraction from common file types:
  - [x] PDFs
  - [x] Text files
  - [x] Office documents (if feasible)
- [x] Create attachment content indexing for search
- [x] Implement attachment metadata indexing
- [x] Create attachment search result display

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### 10. Attachment Service Integration
- [x] Integrate attachment handling with `AttachmentService`
- [x] Create high-level API for UI components
- [x] Implement error handling and recovery strategies
- [x] Create performance monitoring

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

### 11. Attachment Unit Tests
- [x] Create comprehensive unit tests for file operations
  - [x] Test with Unicode filenames
  - [x] Test with various file types and sizes
- [x] Test integration with other components
- [x] Test error handling and recovery

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 12. Attachment Documentation
- [x] Write comprehensive docstrings for all attachment-related classes and methods
- [x] Create usage examples for attachment functionality
- [x] Document supported file types and limitations
- [x] Create best practices for attachment management

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**81-101 hours** (approximately 2-2.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the attachment handling implementation, proceed to implementing the RTF editor integration as outlined in [08_rtf_editor_integration.md](08_rtf_editor_integration.md).
