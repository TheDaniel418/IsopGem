  - [ ] Tag merging functionality
  - [ ] Tag analytics (usage statistics, relationships)
  - [ ] Tag suggestion algorithms
  - [ ] Unicode support for tag names

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 4. Attachment Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/attachment_service.py` implementing `IAttachmentService`:
  - [ ] Add attachment method (file upload handling)
  - [ ] Retrieve attachment method (by UUID)
  - [ ] Update attachment metadata method
  - [ ] Delete attachment method
  - [ ] List attachments method (for a note)
  - [ ] File type validation and security checks
  - [ ] File system operations management
  - [ ] Unicode support for filenames and paths

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 5. Search Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/search_service.py` implementing `ISearchService`:
  - [ ] Whoosh integration for full-text search
  - [ ] Index creation and management
  - [ ] Document indexing (notes, tags)
  - [ ] Search query processing
  - [ ] Result ranking and sorting
  - [ ] Unicode support for search (Greek, Hebrew)
  - [ ] Tag-based filtering
  - [ ] Combined search (text + tags)

**Estimated time:** 12-15 hours

### 6. Backup/Export Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/backup_export_service.py` implementing `IBackupExportService`:
  - [ ] Export all notes, tags, and attachments
  - [ ] Import from exported data
  - [ ] Validation of imported data
  - [ ] Conflict resolution during import
  - [ ] Progress reporting for long operations
  - [ ] Error handling and recovery

**Estimated time:** 8-10 hours

### 7. Cross-Pillar Communication Service Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/cross_pillar_service.py` implementing `ICrossPillarService`:
  - [ ] Message sending interface
  - [ ] Message receiving interface
  - [ ] Event subscription mechanism
  - [ ] UUID-based note referencing
  - [ ] Data transformation for cross-pillar compatibility

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 8. Service Factory Implementation
- [ ] Create `services/factory.py` for service instantiation
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for services
- [ ] Create configuration-based service selection

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

### 9. Service Unit Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Note service
  - [ ] Test all business logic operations
  - [ ] Test validation and error handling
  - [ ] Test Unicode support
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Tag service
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Attachment service
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Search service
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Backup/Export service
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Cross-Pillar service

**Estimated time:** 12-15 hours

### 10. Service Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all service classes and methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for services
- [ ] Document error handling and recovery strategies

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**76-95 hours** (approximately 2-2.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the services implementation, proceed to implementing the UI components as outlined in [05_ui_components.md](05_ui_components.md).
