# Data Models Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This file outlines the tasks required to implement the data models for the Tag-Based Note Management System.

## Tasks

### 1. Note Model Implementation
- [ ] Create `models/note.py` with the following features:
  - [ ] UUID generation and validation
  - [ ] Name property (Unicode support)
  - [ ] Content property (Unicode support, potentially large text)
  - [ ] Created/modified timestamps
  - [ ] Tag relationship management
  - [ ] Attachment relationship management
  - [ ] Serialization/deserialization methods
  - [ ] Validation methods
  - [ ] Equality and comparison methods

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 2. Tag Model Implementation
- [ ] Create `models/tag.py` with the following features:
  - [ ] UUID for tag identification
  - [ ] Name property (Unicode support)
  - [ ] Color property for UI display
  - [ ] Note relationship management
  - [ ] Parent/child relationship for hierarchical tags (optional)
  - [ ] Serialization/deserialization methods
  - [ ] Validation methods
  - [ ] Equality and comparison methods

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours

### 3. Attachment Model Implementation
- [ ] Create `models/attachment.py` with the following features:
  - [ ] UUID for attachment identification
  - [ ] Filename property (Unicode support)
  - [ ] Path property (relative to attachment storage)
  - [ ] MIME type detection
  - [ ] File size calculation
  - [ ] Created/modified timestamps
  - [ ] Note relationship reference
  - [ ] Serialization/deserialization methods
  - [ ] Validation methods

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours

### 4. Model Relationships Implementation
- [ ] Implement many-to-many relationship between Notes and Tags
- [ ] Implement one-to-many relationship between Notes and Attachments
- [ ] Create helper methods for relationship management
- [ ] Implement cascading operations (e.g., deleting a note deletes its attachments)

**Estimated time:** 5-7 hours

### 5. Model Validation and Sanitization
- [ ] Implement input validation for all model properties
- [ ] Create sanitization methods for user input
- [ ] Implement Unicode normalization for consistent storage
- [ ] Create validation for file paths and names

**Estimated time:** 4-5 hours

### 6. Model Unit Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Note model
  - [ ] Test Unicode support with Greek and Hebrew text
  - [ ] Test serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Test validation methods
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Tag model
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for Attachment model
- [ ] Test model relationships and cascading operations

**Estimated time:** 6-8 hours

### 7. Model Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive docstrings for all model classes and methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for models
- [ ] Document model relationships and constraints

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

### 8. Model Factory Implementation
- [ ] Create factory classes for generating model instances
- [ ] Implement methods for creating models from various sources
- [ ] Create sample data generation for testing

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours

## Total Estimated Time
**35-48 hours** (approximately 1-1.5 weeks of development time)

## Next Steps
After completing the data models implementation, proceed to implementing the repositories as outlined in [03_repositories.md](03_repositories.md).
