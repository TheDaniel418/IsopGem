## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Path

For a minimal implementation, follow this dependency path:

1. Project Setup
2. Data Models (basic models only)
3. Repositories (basic CRUD only)
4. Services (core services only)
5. UI Components (basic UI only)
6. Testing (core functionality)
7. Deployment & Integration (basic integration)

## Parallel Development Opportunities

These components can be developed in parallel by different team members:

1. **Track 1**: Data Models → Repositories → Services
2. **Track 2**: UI Components (skeleton) → UI Components (detail)
3. **Track 3**: Search Functionality
4. **Track 4**: Attachment Handling
5. **Track 5**: RTF Editor Integration
6. **Track 6**: Backup & Export
7. **Track 7**: Cross-Pillar Communication
8. **Track 8**: Testing (can start early with unit tests)

## Critical Path

The critical path for implementation is:

1. Project Setup
2. Data Models
3. Repositories
4. Services
5. UI Components
6. Testing
7. Deployment & Integration

Focus resources on these tasks to minimize overall implementation time.
