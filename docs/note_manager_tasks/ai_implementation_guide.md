# AI Implementation Guide for Tag Note System

This guide provides additional technical details, dependencies, decision criteria, and implementation examples to make the task lists more robust for AI implementation.

## Implementation Approach

When implementing tasks from the task lists, follow these guidelines:

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Before starting a task, check its dependencies in the "Dependencies" section of each task.

2. **Implementation Patterns**: Follow the provided code examples and patterns for consistency.

3. **Decision Making**: Use the decision criteria provided for design choices.

4. **Testing**: Implement tests according to the success criteria for each task.

5. **Documentation**: Document your implementation following the provided templates.

## Example Enhanced Task: Note Model Implementation

### Task Description
Implement the Note model class that represents a note in the system, with properties for UUID, name, content, timestamps, and relationships to tags and attachments.

### Dependencies
- Project directory structure must be set up
- Base model interfaces must be defined
- UUID generation utility must be implemented

### Implementation Details

#### Class Structure
```python
class Note:
    def __init__(self, uuid=None, name="", content="", tags=None, created_at=None, modified_at=None):
        self.uuid = uuid or self._generate_uuid()
        self.name = name
        self.content = content
        self.tags = tags or []
        self.attachments = []
        self.created_at = created_at or datetime.now()
        self.modified_at = modified_at or self.created_at
        
    def _generate_uuid(self):
        # Use the UUID utility from utils/helpers.py
        from note_manager.utils.helpers import generate_uuid
        return generate_uuid()
        
    def add_tag(self, tag):
        # Implementation with validation
        pass
        
    def remove_tag(self, tag):
        # Implementation with validation
        pass
        
    def add_attachment(self, attachment):
        # Implementation with validation
        pass
        
    def remove_attachment(self, attachment):
        # Implementation with validation
        pass
        
    def update_content(self, content):
        # Update content and modified timestamp
        pass
        
    def to_dict(self):
        # Serialization to dictionary
        pass
        
    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data):
        # Deserialization from dictionary
        pass
```

#### Validation Requirements
- UUID must be a valid UUID string or generated if None
- Name must be a string (can be empty)
- Content must be a string (can be empty)
- Tags must be a list of Tag objects
- Attachments must be a list of Attachment objects
- Created/modified timestamps must be datetime objects

#### Unicode Support
- Ensure all string fields (name, content) support Unicode characters
- Test with Greek and Hebrew characters
- Implement proper string normalization for consistent storage

### Decision Criteria
- **UUID Generation**: Use UUID4 for random generation to avoid collisions
- **Relationship Management**: Use composition over inheritance for tag and attachment relationships
- **Validation Strategy**: Implement validation in setters rather than just in the constructor

### Testing Criteria
- Unit tests must verify:
  - UUID generation and validation
  - Adding/removing tags and attachments
  - Serialization/deserialization
  - Unicode support with Greek and Hebrew text
  - Timestamp handling

### Example Test Case
```python
def test_note_unicode_support():
    # Create a note with Unicode content
    greek_name = "Σημειώσεις Έργου"
    hebrew_content = "פגישה על פרויקט X"
    
    note = Note(name=greek_name, content=hebrew_content)
    
    # Verify Unicode is preserved
    assert note.name == greek_name
    assert note.content == hebrew_content
    
    # Test serialization and deserialization
    note_dict = note.to_dict()
    restored_note = Note.from_dict(note_dict)
    
    assert restored_note.name == greek_name
    assert restored_note.content == hebrew_content
```

## Implementation Templates

### Model Class Template

class ModelName:
    """
    Description of the model and its purpose.
    
    Attributes:
        attribute_name (type): Description of the attribute.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, param1, param2=default_value):

        Args:
            entity: The entity to create.
            
        Returns:
            The created entity with any generated fields.
            
        Raises:
            RepositoryError: If creation fails.
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
        
    # Other CRUD methods
```

### Service Class Template
```python

    """
    Description of the service and its purpose.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, repository):
        """

            ServiceError: Description of when this exception is raised.
        """
        # Implementation with business logic
        pass
```

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
```python
def operation_with_error_handling():
    try:
        # Operation that might fail
        result = perform_operation()
        return result
    except SpecificError as e:
        # Handle specific error
        log.error(f"Specific error occurred: {e}")
        raise ServiceError(f"Operation failed: {e}") from e
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle unexpected errors
        log.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise ServiceError("An unexpected error occurred") from e
```

### Transaction Pattern
```python
def operation_with_transaction():
    transaction = self.db.begin_transaction()
    try:
        # Perform multiple operations
        result1 = self.db.operation1()
        result2 = self.db.operation2()
        
        # Commit if all operations succeed
        transaction.commit()
        return result2
    except Exception as e:
        # Rollback on any error
        transaction.rollback()
        log.error(f"Transaction failed: {e}")
        raise
```

### Event Publishing Pattern
```python
def operation_with_event():
    # Perform operation
    result = perform_operation()
    
    # Publish event
    event = OperationCompletedEvent(result)
    self.event_publisher.publish(event)
    
    return result
```

## Next Steps for AI Implementation

1. Review each task list and identify which tasks need additional implementation details
2. For complex tasks, create similar detailed guides with code examples
3. Define clear interfaces between components to ensure proper integration
4. Establish testing criteria for each component
5. Create a dependency graph to visualize task relationships
