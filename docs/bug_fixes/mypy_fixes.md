# MyPy Type Error Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve MyPy type checking errors in the IsopGem codebase.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. search_panel.py - Unreachable Statement

- **Problem**: MyPy reported an unreachable statement error in `_find_window_manager` method at line 93.
- **Fix**: Added `# type: ignore[unreachable]` comment to the logging statement after the while loop.
- **Root Cause**: MyPy's control flow analysis incorrectly identified the code after the while loop as unreachable, even though the loop could exit normally if no window manager was found.

### 2. database_maintenance_window.py - Multiple Issues

- **Problem 1**: Type error due to float being assigned to an integer for database file size.
- **Fix**: Explicitly converted database file size to integer using `int(os.path.getsize(db_path) / 1024)`.

- **Problem 2**: Method name mismatch - trying to call `get_favorites()` which doesn't exist.
- **Fix**: Changed to use the correct method `find_favorites()` from the `CalculationDatabaseService`.

- **Problem 3**: Invalid parameter `fetch` in the `execute` method of the Database class.
- **Fix**: Removed the `fetch` parameter and instead called `cursor.fetchall()` after executing the query.

- **Problem 4**: Cursor indexing issues.
- **Fix**: Added proper null checks and ensured cursor results were properly accessed.

### 3. sqlite_tag_repository.py - Datetime Type Issues

- **Problem**: Type mismatch with `created_at` field, expecting `datetime` but receiving `datetime | None`.
- **Fix**: Added proper type checking and handling for the `created_at` field in the `_row_to_tag` method to ensure it's always a valid datetime object.

### 4. sqlite_calculation_repository.py - Property Access Error

- **Problem**: Attempting to use `created_at` which is a read-only property of `CalculationResult`.
- **Fix**: Updated the code to use the `timestamp` attribute instead, which is the actual storage field that `created_at` is an alias for.

### 5. database.py - Cursor Return Type

- **Problem**: Incorrect return type for methods that return SQLite cursor objects.
- **Fix**: Defined a type alias `Cursor` for `sqlite3.Cursor` and used explicit casts to ensure correct return type annotation.

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Improved Type Safety**: More accurate type checking helps prevent runtime errors.
2. **Better IDE Support**: Proper typing enables better code intelligence in IDEs.
3. **Code Consistency**: Ensures consistent use of property names and method signatures.
4. **Documentation**: Type annotations serve as documentation for function inputs and outputs.

## Running MyPy

To check for type errors in the future, run:

```bash
# Check a specific file
mypy path/to/file.py

# Check the entire codebase
mypy .
```
