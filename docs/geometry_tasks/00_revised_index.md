# Sacred Geometry Explorer Development Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the Sacred Geometry Explorer in IsopGem. The Sacred Geometry Explorer will be implemented as a separate window that opens from the existing "Sacred Geometry" button in the Geometry tab. The development is organized into chapters, each containing sequential tasks to implement specific features.

## Development Approach

The Sacred Geometry Explorer will be a GeoGebra-like environment focused on sacred geometry, providing tools for constructing, exploring, and analyzing sacred geometric patterns and relationships. It will open in a separate window, following the application's focus-based window management system.

## Development Chapters

1. [Foundation and Basic Framework](01_foundation_revised.md)
   - Setting up the basic architecture and UI framework for the Sacred Geometry Explorer

2. [Basic Geometric Tools](02_basic_tools.md)
   - Implementing fundamental geometric construction tools

3. [Sacred Geometry Specialized Tools](03_sacred_geometry_tools.md)
   - Adding specialized tools for sacred geometry constructions

4. [Dynamic Geometry System](04_dynamic_geometry.md)
   - Implementing the constraint-based dynamic geometry system

5. [Measurement and Analysis](05_measurement_analysis.md)
   - Adding tools for measuring and analyzing geometric constructions

6. [Templates and Guides](06_templates_guides.md)
   - Creating pre-built templates and step-by-step guides

7. [Advanced Features](07_advanced_features.md)
   - Implementing advanced functionality like fractals and scripting

8. [3D Geometry](08_3d_geometry.md)
   - Adding support for 3D sacred geometry

9. [Integration with Other Pillars](09_integration.md)
   - Connecting with Gematria, Astrology, and other pillars

10. [Polishing and Optimization](10_polishing.md)
    - Final refinements, optimizations, and user experience improvements

## Implementation Strategy

- The Sacred Geometry Explorer will be implemented as a separate module within the Geometry pillar
- It will be opened from the existing "Sacred Geometry" button in the Geometry tab
- The Explorer will follow the application's focus-based window management system
- Each chapter represents a logical phase of development
- Tasks within chapters are designed to be completed sequentially
- Complex tasks are broken down into simpler subtasks

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1: [Foundation and Basic Framework](01_foundation_revised.md) to set up the basic architecture for the Sacred Geometry Explorer.
