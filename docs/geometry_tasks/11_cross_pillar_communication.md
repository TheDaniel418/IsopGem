# Chapter 11: Cross-Pillar Communication & Sacred Services Microservice

## Overview
Implement a microservice and UI integration that allows any pillar (e.g., Gematria, Document Manager) to “Send to Sacred Services.” This will send a number to the Sacred Geometry panel, where it can be visualized as a circle or polygon, and further analyzed with geometric options.

---

### 11.1 Design Sacred Services Microservice API

**Description:**
Define the API and communication protocol for sending numbers and context from other pillars to the Sacred Geometry panel.

**Subtasks:**
1. Specify message format (e.g., JSON: `{ "value": 42, "source": "Gematria", "context": "user_selection" }`)
2. Define API endpoints or event bus topics (e.g., `sacred_services.send_number`)
3. Document supported actions: visualize as circle, polygon, etc.
4. Specify error and acknowledgment messages
5. Define versioning and extensibility strategy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API is documented and reviewed by all pillar leads
- Message format is unambiguous and extensible
- Error handling and feedback are defined

---

### 11.2 Implement “Send to Sacred Services” UI Action

**Description:**
Add a UI action in other pillars (e.g., Gematria) to send a number to Sacred Services.

**Subtasks:**
1. Add “Send to Sacred Services” button/context menu in relevant UIs
2. On click, send the selected number and context to the Sacred Services API
3. Show user feedback (success/failure)
4. Log all send actions for audit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can send a number from any pillar to Sacred Services
- Action is logged and user receives feedback

### 11.3 Sacred Geometry Panel: Receive and Visualize Number

**Description:**
Handle incoming numbers in the Sacred Geometry panel and present visualization options.

**Subtasks:**
1. Listen for incoming messages from the microservice/API
2. Prompt user to choose visualization: circle or polygon
3. If circle: show secondary menu for area, radius, diameter, circumference
4. If polygon: show options for edge length, perimeter, circumcircle/incircle (with area, radius, diameter, circumference)
5. Visualize the number as selected, with clear labeling
6. Allow user to adjust or re-interpret the number with a new menu selection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Sacred Geometry panel receives and visualizes numbers as specified
- All geometric options are available and function correctly
- User can switch between interpretations without resending

---

### 11.4 Error Handling and User Feedback

**Description:**
Ensure robust error handling and clear user feedback throughout the workflow.

**Subtasks:**
1. Handle invalid or out-of-range numbers gracefully
2. Provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. Log all errors to `logs/error.log`
4. Show confirmation dialogs for successful actions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All errors are handled gracefully
- User always knows the status of their action

---

### 11.5 Testing and Integration

**Description:**
Test the end-to-end workflow and integration between pillars.

**Subtasks:**
1. Write unit and integration tests for API, UI, and geometry panel
2. Simulate cross-pillar sends and verify correct visualization
3. Test all menu options and error scenarios
4. Review logs for completeness

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All tests pass
- Integration is robust and user-friendly
