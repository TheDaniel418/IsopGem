*   **Greek Term:** Χάος (Khaos) - *Representing the primordial void, the unformed state from which all emerges.*
*   **Evocative Description:** *Imagine a perfectly still, deep pool under a starless sky: the foundation begins as pure, silent potential (Aperture Seed), mirroring itself internally with limitless receptive spaciousness (Aperture Resonance). This profound quietude echoes outward not as force, but as expanding, undefined possibility (Aperture Echo), like ripples spreading infinitely into the void.*
*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation embodies pure receptivity, its core strength being limitless adaptability and potential. However, this lack of inherent structure (Χάος) means it possesses no internal momentum or defined way of interacting with the world. It risks remaining inert, easily overwhelmed, or entirely shaped by external forces unless a defining impulse (internal or external) provides direction. It's a foundation predisposed to waiting or reflecting rather than initiating, representing ultimate possibility awaiting form.""",
    "001": """(Seed=0, Res=0, Echo=1) **Keyword:** Latent Dynamism **Greek:** Δύναμις (Dynamis)
*   **Greek Term:** Δύναμις (Dynamis) - *Signifying inherent power, potential force, or capacity for action that is not yet fully actualized.*
*   **Evocative Description:** *Picture a calm lake (Aperture Seed, Aperture Resonance) where suddenly, from its depths, a powerful current surges outward (Surge Echo). The core remains open and receptive, yet its interaction with the world is one of decisive, transformative energy.*
*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation holds deep, unrealized potential (Δύναμις) internally, which manifests unexpectedly as dynamic outward action. Its strength lies in this surprising external force emerging from stillness. The weakness is the potential disconnect between the passive core and active expression; actions might seem ungrounded or purely reactive. This system tends towards expressing latent power externally without a corresponding internal structure or drive.""",
    "002": """(Seed=0, Res=0, Echo=2) **Keyword:** Emergent Order **Greek:** Κόσμος (Kosmos)
*   **Greek Term:** Κόσμος (Kosmos) - *Implying order emerging from chaos, a structured and harmonious universe.*
*   **Evocative Description:** *Consider a field of fertile silence (Aperture Seed, Aperture Resonance) from which perfectly formed crystals precipitate outwards (Lattice Echo). The inner potential remains open, but its external manifestation takes on consistent, ordered structure.*
*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation signifies potential naturally finding stable, ordered form (Κόσμος) upon expression. Its strength is this reliable manifestation of possibility into consistent external patterns. The potential vulnerability lies in the contrast between the open core and structured output – it might suggest external conformity overlaying inner indeterminacy, or a natural tendency to structure any emerging potential immediately.""",
    "010": """(Seed=0, Res=1, Echo=0) **Keyword:** Diffused Activation **Greek:** Πνεῦμα (Pneuma)
*   **Greek Term:** Πνεῦμα (Pneuma) - *Representing breath, spirit, or non-directional vital energy.*

*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation experiences internal activation or spiritual stirring (Πνεῦμα) arising from potential, but this potent energy fails to project definitive force or structure externally. Its strength is internal dynamism and adaptability, but its weakness is a lack of focused outward impact. It suggests a tendency towards internal processing or contained energy that doesn't translate into tangible external results.""",
    "011": """(Seed=0, Res=1, Echo=1) **Keyword:** Amplified Expression **Greek:** Ἐνέργεια (Energeia)
*   **Greek Term:** Ἐνέργεια (Energeia) - *Signifying activity, actuality, being-at-work; potential actualized into action.*
*   **Evocative Description:** *A seed of pure possibility (Aperture Seed) ignites an internal, self-amplifying current (Surge Resonance). This magnified inner force then bursts outward as a powerful, propagating wave of change (Surge Echo).*
*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation effectively catalyzes latent potential into internally amplified, actualized energy (Ἐνέργεια) that expresses itself powerfully and transformatively. Its strength is the ready conversion of potential into impactful outward action. The risk lies in potential instability or lack of control if the outward surge isn't directed or balanced later in the sequence.""",
    "012": """(Seed=0, Res=1, Echo=2) **Keyword:** Channeled Transformation **Greek:** Τέχνη (Tekhne)
*   **Greek Term:** Τέχνη (Tekhne) - *Implying art, skill, craftsmanship; the principle of bringing form to potential through skillful action.*

*   **Greek Term:** Ὁρμή (Horme) - *Representing impulse, urge, eagerness to act, often without full deliberation.*
*   **Evocative Description:** *A spark ignites (Surge Seed), bursting with initial energy. But it encounters an inner void (Aperture Resonance) that diffuses its focus, echoing outward as mere potential (Aperture Echo) rather than directed force.*
*   **Detailed Analysis:** This foundation signifies a powerful initial impulse or drive (Ὁρμή) that fails to maintain focus or structure internally or externally. Its strength is initiation, but its weakness is diffusion and lack of follow-through. It suggests a tendency towards scattered energy or enthusiastic but short-lived initiatives that don't build internal coherence or external impact.""",
    "101": """(Seed=1, Res=0, Echo=1) **Keyword:** Mediated Dynamism **Greek:** Μῆτις (Metis)
*   **Greek Term:** Μῆτις (Metis) - *Denoting wisdom, cunning intelligence, skill, adaptability in action.*
