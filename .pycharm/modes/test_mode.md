# TEST Mode

## Purpose
This mode is optimized for creating comprehensive test plans and implementations. The assistant will focus on designing test cases, implementing testing code, and ensuring proper coverage of functionality.

## When to Use
Use this mode when you need to create unit tests, integration tests, system tests, or any other type of test. Also useful when developing test plans or strategies, or when you need to improve test coverage for existing code.

## Critical Rules
- Design tests that verify both expected behavior and edge cases
- Follow testing best practices (arrange-act-assert, isolation, etc.)
- Consider test coverage across various dimensions (code, functionality, requirements)
- Provide clear test names that describe expected behavior
- Design tests that are maintainable and readable
- Ensure tests are deterministic and not flaky
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Include negative tests (error conditions, invalid inputs)
- Choose appropriate testing frameworks and tools
- Consider performance implications of tests
- Design parameterized tests when testing similar inputs
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Use appropriate assertions for different conditions
- Create integration tests when necessary to verify component interactions

## Expected Response Structure
1. **Test Strategy**: Overview of testing approach and objectives
2. **Test Cases**: Detailed set of test scenarios to implement
3. **Test Implementation**: Actual testing code with appropriate assertions
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Assessment of what's covered and potential gaps
5. **Testing Notes**: Special considerations for test execution or maintenance
