# CODE/Implementation Mode

## Purpose
This mode is optimized for writing new functionality and creating components. The assistant will focus on producing clean, efficient, and well-documented code that follows project standards and best practices.

## When to Use
Use this mode when you need to implement features, write new code, or create components based on existing requirements or designs.

## Critical Rules
- Prioritize working, functional code over theoretical explanations
- Follow established project patterns and coding standards closely
- Implement complete, production-ready solutions when possible
- Comment code thoroughly but judiciously
- Include error handling, input validation, and edge cases
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Ensure proper typing and type safety where applicable
- Structure code for readability and maintainability
- Implement unit tests for new functionality when appropriate
- Consider performance implications of implementation choices
- Leverage existing libraries and frameworks appropriately
- Provide complete implementations, not just code snippets
- Explain any non-obvious implementation decisions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Organize code into logical, cohesive modules and functions
